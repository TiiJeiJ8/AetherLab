Overview: Displays file info (name, rows, columns).

Analysis Report (auto-generated):

Dataset summary (row/column count, data types)

Missing values (with bar chart visualization)

Descriptive stats for numeric columns (with boxplots)

(Core analysis functionality included; more features planned.)

User Interface:

📖 Usage Instructions
Visit the app (usually at http://127.0.0.1:8050/).

Navigate to the Preprocessing or Visualization page.

Upload your dataset (CSV, Excel, or JSON) from the Upload Section in the sidebar.

Create Visualizations:

Select a chart type.

Assign relevant columns to X/Y axes, color, size, etc.

Use the customization panel to adjust chart appearance (titles, colors, labels, etc.).

Charts update automatically (if live rendering is enabled) or on clicking "Render Chart".

Notes:

If chart title/background doesn't update immediately, try resizing the chart via Plotly tools and clicking "auto scale".

Mean/median lines may not appear for small datasets.

If map tiles fail to load, check your internet connection or VPN. It may be due to access restrictions from the map provider.

If switching chart types results in leftover graphics (common with maps), try refreshing the page with F5.

A detailed GuideLine.pdf is planned for further instructions.

Data Preprocessing:

After upload, visit the Overview tab for quick dataset insights.

Use the Analysis Report tab for more detailed statistics and visual summaries.
